    <h1>Password Cracking 101: Unveiling Hidden Secrets</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      In this writeup, we explore the fundamentals of password cracking, a key skill in penetration testing and red team engagements. We'll walk through different techniques used to recover plaintext passwords from hashed or encrypted formats.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenge Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The challenge focused on cracking passwords that were stored in various hash formats. The goal was to efficiently crack these hashes using different techniques and tools to understand how they are generated and how they can be exploited in real-world scenarios.
    </p>

    <h2>Password Cracking Techniques</h2>
    <p>The following techniques were employed in this challenge:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Brute Force:</strong> A method that systematically checks every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found. This is the most exhaustive approach.</li>
      <li><strong>Dictionary Attack:</strong> An optimized brute force method using a precompiled list of likely passwords (a dictionary). Faster than brute force due to its narrowed focus.</li>
      <li><strong>Rainbow Tables:</strong> Precomputed tables for reversing cryptographic hash functions, which can significantly speed up cracking by eliminating the need to calculate hashes repeatedly.</li>
      <li><strong>Hash Cracking Tools:</strong> Various tools like <code>Hashcat</code>, <code>John the Ripper</code>, and <code>Cain & Abel</code> were used to apply these methods efficiently to the target hashes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Process</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Hash Identification:</strong> The first step was to identify the hash type. Tools like <code>Hash-Identifier</code> were used to analyze the format of the given password hashes.</li>
      <li><strong>Choosing the Right Attack:</strong> Based on the hash type and complexity, an appropriate attack method (brute force, dictionary, or rainbow tables) was chosen.</li>
      <li><strong>Cracking the Hash:</strong> Using tools like <code>Hashcat</code>, password hashes were cracked. The tool's performance was optimized by using GPU acceleration and adjusting attack parameters.</li>
      <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Once the password was cracked, it was verified to ensure it matched the expected output, confirming the successful application of the cracking technique.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>
      The process revealed several key insights:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Commonly used password patterns (e.g., <code>123456</code>, <code>password</code>) were easily cracked with dictionary attacks.</li>
      <li>More complex hashes (e.g., SHA-256) required longer attack times, but still fell to brute force with adequate resources.</li>
      <li>The rainbow table technique proved effective for commonly used hashes, drastically reducing cracking time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The password cracking challenge highlighted the importance of using strong, unique passwords and employing salted hashes. It also demonstrated the power of modern tools like <code>Hashcat</code> and <code>John the Ripper</code> in simulating real-world cracking scenarios. As a takeaway, always use strong encryption and avoid common password practices to prevent exposure to attacks.
