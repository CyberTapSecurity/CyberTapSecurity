      <h2>Red Team</h2>
      <p>
        Offensive simulation and ethical exploitation. We think like adversaries and operate like them — simulating real-world
        threats with custom payloads, phishing campaigns, and lateral movement. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="team-block">
      <h2>Blue Team</h2>
      <p>
        Defensive operations rooted in visibility and control. From log analysis and SIEM tuning to incident containment and 
        vulnerability mitigation — we respond with speed and clarity.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="team-block">
      <h2>Purple Team</h2>
      <p>
        Bridging the gap between red and blue. Continuous improvement, direct feedback loops, and collaboration over competition. 
        CyberTapSecurity’s hybrid model improves security maturity across all environments.

  <section class="ops-block">
    <h2>Operational Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Led by a U.S. military veteran with intelligence operations experience, our methods are built for real-world readiness. 
      While certain missions and capabilities remain confidential, our impact is always visible — through clean networks, 
      hardened systems, and lessons passed on.
